# This routine creates a stacked data set.
# The key input is the cmap matrix, which has one row for each column 
#  of X and one column per transition.  It may have extra rows if there are
#  proportional baseline hazards
# The first row of smat contains state to strata information.
# Input data is X, Y, strata, and initial state (integer).
#
# For each transition the expanded data has a set of rows, all those whose
#  initial state makes them eligible for the transition.  
# Strata is most often null; it encodes a users strata() addition(s). Such terms
#  occur less often in multistate models (in my experience so far.)

    # Jan 2021: changed from looping once per strata to once per transition.
    #  Essentially, a block of data for each unique column of cmap.  If two
    #  of those columns have the same starting state, it makes me nervous
    #  (statistically), but forge onward and sort the issues out in the
    #  fits.
    # Dec 2024: change to once per stratum.  The issue was multiple
    #  transitions like 1:4 and 1:5 in the same stratum, which led to the
    #  same row of data twice in one stratum; which is not valid.
    # May 2025: further update in conjunction with the "Shared coefficients
    #  shared baselines in multistate models", which forced a re-thinking
    #  of the process.  For the use cases found there, the code below is now
    #  correct.  For others, the data produced may be questionable;
    #  we await an actual use case to work things out.
    # The constructed X matrix will have a block of rows for each column of
    #  cmap such that: the column is not 0, it is not a duplicated of another
    #  cmap column that is in the same stratum.
